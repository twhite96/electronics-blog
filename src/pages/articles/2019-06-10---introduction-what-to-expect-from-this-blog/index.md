This blog is a hobby thing I wanted to do to chronicle my foray into building cool shit with my mountain of tools, resistors, ICs, transistors, potentiometers, and a *really flimsy excuse* to learn how to solder[^1].

So I will post some pics, swear a bit, but ultimately it's my journal...but online and about robots.
