I'm Tiffany, a front-end developer at a really cool consulting firm in Virginia where I get to work from home, here in my loft in PA. I'm also an electronics geek. I have always loved electronics and gadgets and was always thinking of ways to build something that I probably didn't have the materials for. Taking things apart was a no-go in my house.

I *did* try though. It didn't go well.

But it seems I was born with tools in my hands. And because I work as a front-end developer, my love of tech and programming, mixed with my interest in DIY electronics, I have blessed the world with this blog of wtf moments as I build random kit.

You're welcome.
